## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

**Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 

**Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

In class, we walked through this assignment step by step, and that hands-on approach made a huge difference in how I understood the concepts. It was my first time creating an ETL pipeline, and seeing how we transformed raw data into something clean and structured for visualization was incredibly eye-opening. It showed me just how much effort goes into preparing data before anything else can happen, which is something I hadn’t fully appreciated before. One of the parts I enjoyed most was learning how to use Streamlit to build interactive dashboards. Having the opportunity to see the code come to life in a dynamic way was really exciting—it felt like everything we were learning was being tied together in a practical and creative way. We also touched on mapping visualizations with Geopandas and Folium, which introduced me to a whole new way of thinking about spatial data. Some aspects of it felt tricky, but having it broken down in class made it less overwhelming and helped me focus on the key steps involved. Overall, this assignment really helped solidify my understanding of how data is processed and visualized, and the guidance we had in class was invaluable. It’s one thing to read about these tools, but walking through them with examples made the learning process much more meaningful and memorable.
